/* In any  of the programming languages. There are many cases where we 
have to write the same function again and again but with some modifications which is very limited throughout 
the function. These are done with loops or iterations.*/
//First we have loop as FOR//
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
for (let index = 0; index < arr.length; index++) {
    const element = arr[index];
    console.log(element);
}

/*Some important keywords in for loops
1. break-It is used to break the control in loop and exit it .
2. continue-It is use to skip the particular iteration in which the keyword used in.*/
